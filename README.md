TCP Socket Communication
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is a reliable, connection-oriented protocol used for data transmission over a network. Sockets are endpoints for sending and receiving data across a network using TCP.
Practical Demonstration: TCP Socket Communication
Step-by-Step Explanation
1.	Creating a TCP Client and Server:
o	Server: Listens for incoming connections on a specific port.
o	Client: Connects to the server's IP address and port.
2.	Establishing a Connection:
o	The client sends a connection request to the server.
o	The server accepts the connection, establishing a communication channel.
3.	Data Exchange:
o	Both client and server can send and receive data through this channel.
4.	Closing the Connection:
o	After data exchange, either side can close the connection.


A socket is an endpoint for communication between two machines over a network. It's a fundamental concept in network programming, enabling bidirectional data transfer between a client and a server.
Here's a breakdown of key points about sockets:
1.	Endpoint: A socket represents an endpoint in a network communication flow. Each socket is identified by an IP address and a port number.
2.	Bidirectional Communication: Sockets enable bidirectional communication, meaning both the client and server can send and receive data.
3.	IP Address and Port: An IP address identifies a specific machine in a network, while a port number identifies a specific application or service running on that machine. Together, they uniquely identify a socket.
4.	Socket Types: Sockets can be of different types, such as stream sockets (e.g., TCP) and datagram sockets (e.g., UDP), each with its own characteristics and behavior.
5.	Connection Establishment: For stream sockets (e.g., TCP), a connection must be established between the client and server before data transfer can occur. This typically involves a handshake process.
6.	Data Transfer: Once a connection is established, data can be transferred between the client and server using the socket's read and write operations.
7.	Protocol Independence: Sockets provide a level of abstraction over the underlying network protocols (e.g., TCP/IP, UDP), allowing applications to communicate without needing to understand the intricacies of the network stack.
